# First Day Setup: Your Development Environment

## Code Editor

The code editor is a piece of software that is used to create and edit text files. It's like Microsoft Word, but for code files instead of word processing documents. In this class, we'll use Sublime Text.

### Download and Install Sublime Text

[Click here to get Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). I recommend the Sublime 3 Beta. Download the appropriate installer for your computer and run it.

It's free to try out, but after 30 days you might get nagged to pay for it (which you should do).

Also don't miss the "unofficial" but excellent [documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/index.html).

## Git and Github

Git is a technology that professional developers use to store their code and share it with others. Github is a company that provides a popular hosted Git service.

### Download and Install the Github App

[For Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)

### Create a Github account

Sign up for a free Github account at [the Github website](https://github.com/). You'll be using your Github account for lots of things in class – including turning in your homework and tracking your attendance in class – so keep your account information at the ready!

## Computer Setup

### Create a folder to store your code

On Mac, create a folder called *code* directly underneath your *home directory*. In the *Finder*, find your *home directory*, which should be accessible via the sidebar – it's the one with the "house" icon and is marked with the username you've used to log-in to your computer.

On Windows, create a folder called *code* in the root of your C:\ drive.
