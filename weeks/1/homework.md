# Due Next Thursday by 9PM 

Practice what we did in class.  You should be able to:

1. Create a new text file named "me.html"
2. Add the content as shown on [#]this page.
3. View the page in your browser. 

There should be no styling yet.  It should appear to be one giant paragraph.

4. Markup the page by indicating the meaning for various parts of the text.
5. The browser tab should display "About Me".

You should use these elements at least once:

* h1
* p
* ul
* li
* a
* h2
* body
* html
* title
* head

5. Sync your code into your GitHub.com account no later than Thursday at 9pm.
