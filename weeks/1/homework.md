_NOTE: This week's homework won't be graded._

# Due Before Friday

**1. Setup Your Development Environment**

* Get a free [GitHub.com](https://github.com) account
* [Install and configure Sublime Text](http://jeffcohenonline.com/setting-up-sublime)
* [Install Virtual Box and Vagrant]()

# Due Before Next Tuesday

Practice what we did in class.  You should be able to:

1. Start up your virtual dev box (hint: `vagrant up` and `vagrant ssh` will be helpful)
2. Change to the `hello` directory: `cd projects/hello`
3. Start the web server (`rails server`).
4. Browse to `http://localhost:3000` to see the Welcome Aboard page.

and then satisfy the following user story:

1. As a site visitor, I want to visit `http://localhost:3000/projects/list` to see a list of the four major NASA projects that took us to the moon (X-15, Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo).  Each project should have a bit of information to go with it.

**BONUS.** Display an image of the moon (hint: research the `img` tag).
