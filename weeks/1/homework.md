Practice what we did in class.  You should be able to:

1. Create a new text file named "me.html"
2. Add the content as shown on [#]this page.
3. View the page in your browser. 

There should be no styling yet.  It should appear to be one giant paragraph.

4. Markup the page by indicating the meaning of each section of text.

You should be able to use these elements at least once:

* h1
* p
* ul
* li
* a
* h2

5. Sync your code into your GitHub.com account no later than Thursday at 9pm.
